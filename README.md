Snake-rs is a snake game written in rust. Aim to be played on the terminal whenever you have to wait for system update, ansible, build, etc... to finish.

# Motivation
After reading ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ "Title"), I wanted to make a simple stuff that could help me learn Rust.
And it reminds me that I had wrote a snake game in Python years ago for the same purpose.
However, it was a little bit different this time because I had a proper Neovim + auto completion setup, instead of Gedit.
So I was pretty much flying blindly with documentations on my fingertips and it was quite fun ngl.
